## How I can add a picture?
This is a simple project that does not download data about files from the database, etc. To add a photo, add it in the "img" folder, enter the name with the next number and the extension ".jpg". Then you need to include them in the file "main.js", in which you should add the file name, its title and date in the lists: "listOfImgNames", "listOfImgTitles", "listOfImgDates"
